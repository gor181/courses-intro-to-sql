title: "Intro to SQL for Data Science"
description: "The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables called <em>relational databases</em>. Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced <em>ess-que-ell</em>, or <em>sequel</em>). This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with databases today!"
